# DESCRIPTION
### Concept:
"Home Design: Green Oasis" is a simulation game where players design and build their dream homes while incorporating sustainable features such as space for planting trees, flowers, and orchards. The game emphasizes environmental stewardship by encouraging players to maintain and care for their green spaces through daily sustainability tips.

### Gameplay Mechanics:
1. **Home Design**: Players start by designing their homes, including the layout, architecture, and interior decor. They can choose from a variety of eco-friendly building materials and energy-efficient appliances.

2. **Green Space Design**: Players allocate space around their homes for planting trees, flowers, and orchards. They can customize the landscape design, select plant species, and arrange the garden layout to their liking.

3. **Construction and Maintenance**: As construction begins, players oversee the building process, ensuring that their homes are constructed in an environmentally responsible manner. They can monitor the progress and make decisions to minimize environmental impact.

4. **Daily Sustainability Tips**: Once construction is complete, players receive daily sustainability tips related to plant care, water conservation, composting, and other eco-friendly practices. These tips help players maintain their green spaces and promote environmental awareness.

### Interactive Gameplay:
1. **Plant Care Tasks**: Players engage in tasks such as watering plants, pruning trees, and fertilizing soil to ensure the health and growth of their green spaces.
  
2. **Weather Challenges**: Players must adapt to changing weather conditions such as rain, drought, and heatwaves, which affect plant growth and require adjustments to their care routines.

3. **Community Engagement**: Players can visit neighbors' homes to exchange gardening tips, share resources, and participate in community gardening events.

### Progression and Rewards:
1. **Garden Expansion**: As players progress, they unlock additional space and features for expanding their gardens, such as greenhouses, rainwater harvesting systems, and compost bins.
   
2. **Green Ratings**: Players receive ratings and feedback on their sustainability efforts, with rewards for achieving high levels of environmental stewardship.

3. **Achievements**: Players earn achievements for milestones such as planting a certain number of trees, attracting wildlife to their gardens, or winning gardening competitions.

### Graphics and UI Design:
1. **Vibrant Graphics**: The game features vibrant, lush visuals that showcase the beauty of nature and encourage players to immerse themselves in their virtual gardens.

2. **Intuitive Interface**: The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing players to easily navigate through the game's features and manage their green spaces.

### Testing and Iteration:
1. **Beta Testing**: Conduct beta testing to gather feedback from players and identify areas for improvement in gameplay, mechanics, and user experience.

2. **Updates and Enhancements**: Continuously update the game based on player feedback, adding new features, content, and improvements to enhance the overall experience.

### Launch and Marketing:
1. **App Store Release**: Launch the game on app stores for iOS and Android devices, with promotional efforts to reach a wide audience of eco-conscious gamers.

2. **Environmental Partnerships**: Partner with environmental organizations and influencers to promote the game and raise awareness about sustainable living practices.
